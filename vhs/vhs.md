# Digitizing VHS Tapes

## Hardware

I used a VCR that had an S-Video output to get slightly higher quality as opposed to RCA (composite) output and tried several cheap capture devices from Amazon.  This generic [device](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X42H9VZ) created color distortions and the [Elgato USB 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029U2YSA) was not supported on M1/M2 macs even though it was highly recommended.  Basically any low end capture device can cause artifacts and rainbow effects.

## Capturing Raw Footage

I followed a great article by Tim Ford on how to setup OBS for lossless digitizing VHS tapes [here](https://timfordphoto.com/lossless-422-digitizing-of-video-tapes-using-obs/).  
I am archiving this page so that I never lose the instructions [here]().
