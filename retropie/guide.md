## Important

* Always power the RetroPie on and off with the **POWER BUTTON**. It is configured to cleanly shutdown the system via the button, you need to give it a few seconds to shutdown services and then power the system off.  You may corrupt the system if you just pull the power.
* To exit a game press the HOTKEY button and START button at the same time.  See controller image.
* There are over 20K games on this device, I have put the top 10 games from the most popular 8 consoles in **FAVORITES** to get you started.
* **DO NOT** run the scrapper (it gets metadata and artwork).  It has already been downloaded and stored on the USB drive.  If you run the scrapper you will override the existing artwork and metadata and it may fill up the internal SD card that runs the operating system.
* If you lose audio, shut the system down and reseat the hdmi cable.  Go into the RetroPie menu option and scroll up and down until you hear the menu sound effects again.  Try rebooting your TV.
* Each different gaming console has different controller mappings see the links below to help understand what buttons do what of reach console if you can not figure it out.
