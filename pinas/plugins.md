## Install OMV Plugins

It is wise to install all the OMV plugins you plan on using since some plugins add users/groups and change system configuration.  

From the OMV GUI:

### System>Plugins

Install the following plugins:
* openmediavault-nut (only if you are connected to UPS that you want to integrate with for graceful shutdowns on a critical battery alert)
* openmediavault-sftp (only if you plan on exposing files via SFTP)
